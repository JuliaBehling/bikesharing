## Overview of Analysis:

The purpose of Analyzing the NYC Citibike data was to create a business proposal for potential investors. This proposal discusses expanding a bike sharing service to different cities across the United States. The data was analyzed and displayed in a visual aid software called Tableau to creat a beautiful and interactive story to easily display trends with the acquired data.

The data was displayed and analyzed based on:

* Total rides based on Gender.
* Total length of usage time for each ride.
* Popularity of usage rate by hour/ day per week.

## Results:

## Summary:

Bike sharing is a popular and lucrative business in New York City. It was discovered the vast majority of users were male, utilized the service for an average of 10 minutes per trip, and most commonly used between 7am-8am and 5pm-6pm. There was a significant drop off in poopularity when the bikes had to be used past the 10 minute mark, insinuating customers prefer other modes of transportation when the ride becomes a certain distance away. It is important to note New York is a very metropolitan city, with a highly dense population and plethora of activities/restaraunts/shops all compiled together. When expanding this service to other areas of the US, there is a high likelihood there will be more suburban-based and spaced out city landscapes. Strategic placement of the bikes would be necessary to encourage use.
